To execute the program, run the Menu class in the isomorphism directory.
It will then ask you to make a choice between the most basic coloring or the (possibly) faster coloring.
This choice is made by entering either 1 or 2 respectively.
It will then ask you to choose whether to find an isomorphism or to count the automorphisms.
This choice is also made by entering either 1 or 2 respectively.
It will then ask for the filename of the file that holds the graphs. For files outside of this directory ..\ is needed to go up one directory,
so for the test instances the filename would be ..\tests\data\*.grl.
After the graphs from the file are tested, you will be asked if you want to read another file. This choice is made with either Y or N.
This file will then be read using the same options as chosen earlier.
